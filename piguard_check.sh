#                       https://github.com/dweeber/WiFi_Check
#
# Purpose:
#
# Check various known error conditions on Raspberry Pi seen in connection with
# the PiGuard Setup and try to fix them.
# This is not a perfect solution, ideally we should find the root cause for the
# problems in the first place (proactive) instead of trying to fix them after
# failure - but honesty right now this is all we have resources to do.
#
# Specific Problem 1
# if eth0 is not connected or it is connected to a device that
# has not powered on its ethernet interface, then isc-dhcp-server
# will fail to start. This means dhcp-clients attached to the
# Raspberry being unable to obtain an IP address via dhcp
#
# This script checks to see if dhcp is running and if not
# restart dhcp then toggle eth0 to force attached devices to
# renew their dhcp lease
#
# Specific Problem 2
#
# Wifi or lan interface is down in such a way that there is no IP address assigned
# to the interface, bounce the interface.
#
# Specific Problem 3
#
# Check if ftp_upload is running and restart it if is not.
#
# Uses a lock file which prevents the script from running more
# than one at a time.  If lockfile is old, it removes it
#
# Instructions:
#
# o Install where you want to run it from like ~/ftp_upload
# o chmod +x ~/ftp_upload/piguard_check.sh
# o Add to crontab
#
# Run 1 min after boot and then every 5 min
# Note sudo must be used on raspbian to execute in /usr/local/bin
# so make sure you are usings sudo's crontab like this
#
# sudo crontab -e
#
# @reboot  sleep 60 && ~/ftp_upload/piguard_check.sh
# */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/piguard_check.sh
